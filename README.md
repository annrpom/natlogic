# Natural Language Processing
## Larry Moss


Hello, this README is basically useless for now since this repo is private, but I might use this to jot down ramblings of a documentation before I try to start making everything look pretty with Jupyter.


Plan:
- [ ] Functional Code
- [ ] Rough Documentation
- [ ] Refactored Code
- [ ] Full Documentation (Jupyter)
- [ ] Overview
